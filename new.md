On average, a new package is released to CRAN every 5 hours

CRAN provides an [availablity table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) and 
there is also the informative [CRANberries site](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/) plus twitter announcements
but it is still hard to  keep track of all the new developments

Here, you can find a table of all the new ones for a date range of your choice with links to the
index page on CRAN for more information
